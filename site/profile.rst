Leftfield was started by myself, Dugal Harris.  I have been writing operational software and doing research for many years; with diverse experience, mostly centered around the interpretation of images.  My skills include remote sensing, image processing and machine learning.  Currently, I develop mainly in `python <https://www.python.org/>`_, but am also fluent in `C++ <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B>`_, and have explored a number of other languages.  I hold an MSc in Electronic Engineering, and a PhD in GeoInformatics.  I live in Rheenendal, South Africa.
